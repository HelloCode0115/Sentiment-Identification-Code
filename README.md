This is the implementation of my work.  
I constructed a network model DA-MLCNN based on dual-attention multilayer feature fusion using VGGNet-16 as the base network.The model employs a multilayer fully convolutional network to extract multi-scale image features, and introduces spatial attention mechanism and channel attention mechanism to enhance the representation of features at different levels.

## Datasets
We conducted our experiments using the EmotionROI dataset, which consists of 1,980 emotion images collected from the social networking site Flickr, containing a total of 6 categories of emotions, namely fear, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise, and joy.
